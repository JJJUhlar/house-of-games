# House Of Games - A forum for board-games reviews

House of Games is a forum for Board-Games reviews. There are a variety of categories of boardgames for users to explore, including 'Strategy,' 'Social Deduction,' and 'Deck Building Games' to name a few.
Reviews can be filtered in a variety of ways such as by the title, author, date published, and number of comments.
Logged in House of Games, users are able to vote on reviews, and leave comments on posted reviews.
For the purposes of demonstration. The user is logged in by default as 'tickle122'
